## PCIDSS Compliant Oracle Gateway

PCIDSS Compliant Oracle contains set of services to process ISO-8583 services, sync with Substrate chain and maintain local ledger. In a nutshell, it mocks a traditional bank which has issued some cards and is currently used for implementing a PoC implementation of ISO-8583 on a Substrate based blockchain.

### What it does?

Oracle service implements an RPC API for processing incoming ISO-8583 messages via `MsgProcessor` trait of `iso_8583rs` crate. In the future watcher service will be added, which will be used to subscribe to the Substrate chain for further integration of ISO-8583 standard.

### How to run

**Pre-requisites**

- Rust toolchain (tested with version 1.72.0)
- Postgres database (tested with version 14.9)

OR

- Docker and docker-compose

To run the oracle locally:

```bash
make run

# OR

RUST_LOG=info cargo run --release -p pcidss-oracle -- --dev
```

To build the binary for release and run it:

```bash
make build
# OR
cargo build --release


RUST_LOG=info ./target/release/pcidss-oracle
```

#### Docker and docker-compose

To start the oracle with the deployed Docker image and Postgres Docker container:
    
```bash
docker-compose up
```

If you want to build the Docker image locally, you will need to change Postgres settings to allow Docker container to connect to it (listened_addresses and trust authentication method).

To build the Docker image:

```bash
make docker-build
# OR
docker build --platform linux/x86_64 -t pcidss-oracle .
```

To run the Docker image:

```bash
make docker-run
# OR
# NOTE: your Postgres database should be accessible via host.docker.internal
docker run -p 0.0.0.0:3030:3030 --platform linux/x86_64 -it pcidss-oracle --database-host host.docker.internal --iso8583-spec /usr/bin/spec.yaml
```

#### CLI

Oracle service accepts the following arguments (which can be seen by running `pcidss-oracle --help`):

```bash
Usage: pcidss-oracle [OPTIONS]

Options:
      --database-host <DATABASE_HOST>
          Path to the Postgres database [default: localhost]
      --database-port <DATABASE_PORT>
          Port of the Postgres database [default: 5432]
      --database-user <DATABASE_USER>
          Username of the Postgres database [default: postgres]
      --database-name <DATABASE_NAME>
          Name of the Postgres database [default: postgres]
      --chain-endpoint <CHAIN_ENDPOINT>
          Substrate chain websocket endpoint [default: ws://localhost:9944]
      --iso8583-spec <ISO8583_SPEC>
          ISO-8583 specification file [default: spec.yaml]
      --rpc-port <RPC_PORT>
          RPC port [default: 3030]
      --dev
          Run in development mode (development accounts are injected)
  -h, --help
          Print help
```

> **_NOTE:_** Make sure you pass your local postgres configuration in case it differs from the default values (e.g. `pcidss-oracle --database-host localhost --database-port 5432 --database-user postgres --database-name postgres`). Otherwise, you won't be able to run the oracle.

#### Testing

Oracle service has tests for the ISO-8583 message processing logic. You can run them with:

```bash
make test
# OR
cargo test --workspace --exclude oracle-e2e-tests
```

> **_NOTE:_** Integration tests are run in parallel by default. This might cause issues with Postgres database, so we should run them in a single thread and one by one.

There is also a separate crate for testing end to end flow of the oracle service, however, it depends on the running Substrate client and Oracle, so it is not included in the main test suite.

```bash
cargo test -p oracle-e2e-tests
```

#### Linting and formatting

Oracle service uses `rustfmt` and `clippy` for formatting and linting. You can run them with:

```bash
make lint
```
